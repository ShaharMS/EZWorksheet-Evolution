## Reporting an issue

### Hard Crashes

After a hard crash, you'll see a new window popping up, containing text.
to report that crash, you'll need to tell me what you did before the app hard crashed, and then paste the text
from that new window in the error, between three backticks, like so:

\`\`\`\
error here\
\`\`\`

and submit :)
